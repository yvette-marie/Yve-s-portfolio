        <h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
        <p> Hello, I'm <span>Yvette Marie A. Sumampong </span>, a passionate student with big dreams and an unwavering curiosity about the universe. Born on <span>May 21, 2009</span>, I'm currently pursuing my education at <span>Ramon Teves Pastor Memorial Dumaguete Science High School</span>, where I continue to strive academically. <br>
            <br>
            I have always been captivated by the mysteries of the universe, it's so terrifying yet so beautiful. The vastness of space and the secrets it holds have always ignited my imagination and curiousity. It is my burning ambition to <span>attend the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)</span> because their Physics programs has always continued to fascinate me. And I dream to soon become a successful <span>cosmologist/astrophysicist</span>. <br>
            <br>
            I am a huge <span>cat person</span> and I, too enjoy activities like stargazing, listening to music, and cooking. I enjoy <span>stargazing</span> the most, seeing the stars twinkling so beautifully in the night sky is comforting to me. Everytime I can stargaze, I always take my time to appreciate it. I cannot explain through words the amount of happiness I feel whenever I stargaze, sometimes even to the point that it leaves me speechless and tears form in my very eyes. <br>
            <br>
            However, my aspirations extend beyond personal achievement. I am driven by the desire to <span>give back to those who have supported me throughout my journey</span>, especially <span>my mom</span>. Her unwavering love and sacrifices have fueled my determination to reach for the stars. I dream of a future where <span>I can provide financial security for my family and myself where I don't have to worry about the cost of expenses</span>. Through my accomplishments, I aim to create a life where I can enjoy the things I love, including <span>being able to travel around the world and experience new adventures, discover the mysteries of the universe above, and enjoy life itself.</span>
